### Day 2: 02 May 2022
**Today's Progress**: Made small paycheck calculator, figured out how to turn ints into strings with str()

**Thoughts**: Was a good day, VSCode is fun AF. 

**Link(s) to work**: in github.

### Day 3: 03 May 2022
Today's Progress: Updated paycheck calculator to accept user input and prevent unexpected return.

Thoughts: Was a fun project, would like to add tax calc, but i dunno how to use % yet.

Links: on USB

### Day 4: 04 May 2022
Today's Progress: learned about functions in python: def, as well as return.

Thoughts: This is almost like learning another verbal language, so difficult but it feels great to learn something new. 

Links: on usb

### Day 5: 05 May 2022
Sick with flu, skipped day.

### Day 6: 06 May 2022
Today's Progress: learned some javascript on khan academy, as well as not(!) operators, OR(||), and(&&) on Swift playgrounds.

Thoughts: i beat a tough puzzle on swift playgrounds, and it was fun learning a little js. 

Links: web or swift

### Day 7: 07 May 2022
Today's Progress: learned rect function in JS, a line function, as well as ellipse. Also while loops on fCC, and breaks. 

Thoughts: line is a weird function, kind of hard to understand

Links: github, or khan academy

### Day 8: 08 May 2022
Today's Progress: sick, but still managed to learn a little about random numbers in python, and how to import modules.

Thoughts: head hurts but was a fun lesson.

Links: Github/ roomSearch.py

### Day 9: 09 May 2022
Today's Progress: learned in depth how git works with Twilio Quest.

Thoughts: was fun, excited to learn more, still a bit confused about verbiage, such as pull, clone, push, and fetch.

### Day 10: 10 May 2022
Today's Progress: learned while loops in swift. also learned a bit more python, esp modulus % to find remainder, / to div, // to div ints only, etc. 

Thoughts: tired of being sick when im finally deciding to learn, feels like im being tested lol.

### Day 11
Today's Progress: learned about fstrings, and more details about functions, also definite loops, and data filtering. Last, I learned more about my toolbox in swift.

Thoughts: learned a ton today, love fstrings so much, makes it so natural and easy.

### Day 12
Today's Progress: became a legend with nested loops in swift, also learned indexed strings.

Thoughts: my brain melted today, but i figured out better how nested while loops work.

### Day 13
Today's Progress: learned string slicing and call functions.

Thoughts: was easier but still a lot of learning.

### Day 14 -14 May 2022
Today's Progress: learned some very basics about assembly, and file handling in python.

Thoughts: assembly seems insanely difficult, and i want a cooler keyboard.

### Day 15
**Today's Progress**: learned about opening files and filtering them in python, which will be useful in programs or making my first to-do list app. 

**Thoughts**:  Hoping to learn about adding and changing things so I can work on my first project. 

### Day 16 -16 May 2022
**Today's Progress**: started work on the minesweeper game project. learned that i should master 1 language before moving forward, however C is good to circle back to, perhaps with a print book.

**Thoughts**: so much fun, but i spent 30 mins just sizing the window, and it's still not final.

### Day 17
**Today's Progress**: reinforced current principals using Sololearn

**Thoughts**: Sololearn is so much fun, and I also made a Stack Overflow acct.

### Day 18
**Today's Progress**: learned vim commands and more python in sololearn.

**Thoughts**: vim is so much fun, it's got a learning curve, but manipulating entire lines of code in two keystrokes is very powerful, i dunno why no one includes these commands by default.

### Day 19
**Today's Progress**: did more sololearn to reinforce knowledge. also learned operators hands on.

**Thoughts**: i learned how to avoid more mistakes, so that was the most important thing today. 

### Day 20
**Today's Progress**: learned about breaks and continues in loops. 

**Thoughts**: i really don't like loops but they're so necessary and good for efficiency. 

### Day 21
**Today's Progress**: made a BMI calculator and learned lists in python.

**Thoughts**: lists are kind of a pain, but it was very helpful understanding that i can make a 2d grid essentially.

### Day 22
**Today's Progress**: learned string indexing and for loops refinforcement in python.

**Thoughts**: for loops are very useful for repetition.

### Day 23
**Today's Progress**: learned ranges and list slicing in python

**Thoughts**: i dont see how list slicing is important yet, but everything has a purpose. at least 2d grids are very good.

### Day 24
**Today's Progress**: created a range calculator, to sum up all items in a range, and a weekly hour calculator.

**Thoughts**: this day was the most fun so far, and helped make the slow hours go by, as i could see at a glance how much of the week was left. 

### Day 25
**Today's Progress**: learned what functions are and how they're represented. 

**Thoughts**: this was just a refresher but a good one, i actually learned functions in swift. 

### Day 26
**Today's Progress**: learned list functions, such as max, min, .append(), .remove(), etc. 

**Thoughts**: this is very useful to remove outliers i believe.

### Day 27 / 27-May-2022
**Today's Progress**: learned string functions such as .format(), .join(), .replace(), .upper(), .lower(), .split(), .startswith(), .endswith(), also learned to define functions.

**Thoughts**:
