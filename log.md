**Thoughts**:  Hoping to learn about adding and changing things so I can work on my first project. 

### Day 16 -16 May 2022
**Today's Progress**: started work on the minesweeper game project. learned that i should master 1 language before moving forward, however C is good to circle back to, perhaps with a print book.

**Thoughts**: so much fun, but i spent 30 mins just sizing the window, and it's still not final.

### Day 17
**Today's Progress**: reinforced current principals using Sololearn

**Thoughts**: Sololearn is so much fun, and I also made a Stack Overflow acct.

### Day 18
**Today's Progress**: learned vim commands and more python in sololearn.

**Thoughts**: vim is so much fun, it's got a learning curve, but manipulating entire lines of code in two keystrokes is very powerful, i dunno why no one includes these commands by default.

### Day 19
**Today's Progress**: did more sololearn to reinforce knowledge. also learned operators hands on.

**Thoughts**: i learned how to avoid more mistakes, so that was the most important thing today. 

### Day 20

**Thoughts**: i really don't like loops but they're so necessary and good for efficiency. 

### Day 21

**Thoughts**: for loops are very useful for repetition.

### Day 23
**Today's Progress**: learned ranges and list slicing in python

**Thoughts**: i dont see how list slicing is important yet, but everything has a purpose. at least 2d grids are very good.

### Day 24
**Today's Progress**: created a range calculator, to sum up all items in a range, and a weekly hour calculator.

**Thoughts**: this day was the most fun so far, and helped make the slow hours go by, as i could see at a glance how much of the week was left. 

### Day 25
**Today's Progress**: learned what functions are and how they're represented. 

**Thoughts**: this was just a refresher but a good one, i actually learned functions in swift. 

### Day 26

**Thoughts**: this is very useful to remove outliers i believe.

### Day 27 / 27-May-2022

**Thoughts**: 

### Day 28

**Thoughts**: i can't figure how to use these lol. 

### Day 29 / 29-May-2022
**Today's Progress**: learned how to open files and count lines in py. 

**Thoughts**: this will be useful in making save files possibly. 

### Day 30

**Thoughts**: this is handy, but i can't see myself using it over a comment.

### Day 31
**Today's Progress**: learned a ton of C++, which is similar to how learning C# in college was, but this is a bit tougher and less like java lol.

**Thoughts**: some of the syntax is a pain in the keister, so much to remember, python is so easy. cpp is like "cout, cin, std, namespace, #include, ;, return 0", and then some.

### Day 32 //01-June-2022
**Today's Progress**: learned lists in python.

**Thoughts**: it's cool how strings aren't directly editable, yet lists(arrays) are.

### Day 33
**Today's Progress**: refresher on manipulating lists in python

**Thoughts**: this will be useful for storing data as needing, and i love the sort function especially. 

### Day 34
**Today's Progress**: learned how to split strings into lists. also refreshed myself on round function, there is no .round, just var = round(item, round #)

**Thoughts**: i dont see the practical use in my case, but it's good to know i guess.

### Day 35 // 04-June-2022
**Today's Progress**: learned about dictionaries in python, and how they are similar to lists but without indexes exactly.
