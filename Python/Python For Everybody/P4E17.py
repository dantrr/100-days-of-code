# web services
# xml and json are the most popular "wire formats"
# xml is extensible markup language
# serialization converts data from one format, to another
# xml is organized as a tree.(like html)
# a schema is essentially a plan or layout for an xml style.

#json is javascript object notation, and represents data as nested lists and dictionaries

# service oriented approach: 
# using multiple programs/services/systems to split problems between two "applications"

# APIs, application program interface
# allows you to connect to another program using your own program or software, to pull or issue data

# APIs are not "free"
# you need a key to access APIs.

######## Python Objects

# object is self contained code, and data
# objects divide problems into smaller parts
# they have boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed detail
# strings are objects, integers are, dictionaries are, etc. 

# a class is a template

#example: 
# class - Dog
# Method= bark() - a method is a defined capability of a class
# field or attribute - a bit of data in a class- length
# object - an instance of a class
# instance - particular instance of a class, for example, if Class is Dog, an object may be "Fido"
# a method is the object's abilities, a method is a verb essentially
# class is like the blueprint, while the object is a built class.
