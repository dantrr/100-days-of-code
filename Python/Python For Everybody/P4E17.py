# web services
# xml and json are the most popular "wire formats"
# xml is extensible markup language
# serialization converts data from one format, to another
# xml is organized as a tree.(like html)
# a schema is essentially a plan or layout for an xml style.

#json is javascript object notation, and represents data as nested lists and dictionaries

# service oriented approach: 
# using multiple programs/services/systems to split problems between two "applications"

# APIs, application program interface
# allows you to connect to another program using your own program or software, to pull or issue data
