A program that tracks work time, and calculates how much "reward" time you've earned. 
For example; you work 1 hour, so you earn 15 minutes of video game time, or something good.

I got the idea for this program from a dopamine detox video on youtube about how much of modern life revolves around cell phone usage, and the internet as a whole. Also pick a day to dopamine detox.
